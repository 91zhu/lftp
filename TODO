The items with a question mark are questionable. I'm not sure whether they
are really needed. If you think it is a good feature do it yourself :) or
at least tell me what you think. Items marked with - are hard to implement
currently; some need other work to be done.


 * complete group/gpass and ACCT (does anyone need it?)

?* save command history (to different files for diff hosts?)

 * Http-style proxy support for ftp.
   Maybe as a new protocol: hftp?

?* document variables in on-line help

 * mirror --config <file.cf>

?* a way to not preserve timestamps.

?* eval -f "foo $1 $2; ls $@" a1 a2 a3

 * parent->GrabOutput GrabFD? to disable status line

 * ftpcopy glob, multiple files

-* progress indicator for ftpcopy

 * glob each directory component in FtpGlob
-  problem: have to assume server does globbing and support backslash-quotes,
   or that it does neither

 * update process title
 * at-exit-bg

 * implement Queueing in FileAccess. fa->AddQueue(new FAQueueOp(args)).
   (Done()==true when queue is empty)

 * there are many interesting protocols: smb, fsp, fish, ...

 * split off NetworkFA class.

 * put -n (only if newer) Maybe it would be better to add a command to compare
   times?

 * http: ls -a to see all links, even off-site.
 * mirror: --log=file write actions to file, --script=file prepare script of
   actions to be done.

 * FileCopy class. (use it in get, put)

 * `local' command to swap local/remote, e.g.
      mirror -R = local mirror
      put = local get
   of course, implement commands using two sessions where possible.

 * make debug output to clear/redraw prompt.

 * safety: options for permanent backup, maybe complain instead of overwriting.
