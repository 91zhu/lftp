The items with a question mark are questionable. I'm not sure whether they
are really needed. If you think it is a good feature do it yourself :) or
at least tell me what you think. Items marked with - are hard to implement
currently; some need other work to be done.


 * complete group/gpass and ACCT (does anyone need it?)

?* save command history (to different files for diff hosts?)

 * Http-style proxy support for ftp.
   Maybe as a new protocol: hftp?

?* document variables in on-line help

 * mirror --config <file.cf>

?* a way to not preserve timestamps.

?* eval -f "foo $1 $2; ls $@" a1 a2 a3

 * parent->GrabOutput GrabFD? to disable status line

 * ftpcopy glob, multiple files

-* progress indicator for ftpcopy

 * glob each directory component in FtpGlob
-  problem: have to assume server does globbing and support backslash-quotes,
   or that it does neither

 * update process title
 * at-exit-bg

 * for http: ls -f file.html to extract links.
